Early Stages of parsing NFL in order to see in it in DataFrames and then use it for Fantasy Football Later on.
Very Early on Stage of a program I'm currently working on. Looking at using the Beautiful Soup Module to extract data using a HTML parser embedded within the module. Long term want to be able to use this as a basis for selecting which players are the best for NFL Fantasy teams based on previous performance. Currently have coded the parsing of the data but have not accounted for Value Error's that may occur with the User Inputs. Have only worked on it for a couple of days so not USER friendly.
