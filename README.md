# NFL-Stats-
Early Stages of correctly parsing the whole NFL website in order to access stats of NFL players and then use it as a potential Guide for Fantasy Football Later on.
Very Early on Stage of a program I'm currently working on. Using the Beautiful Soup Module(bs4) to extract data using a HTML parser embedded within the module. Long term want to be able to use this as a basis for selecting which players are the best for NFL Fantasy teams based on previous performance. Currently have coded the parsing of the data but have not accounted for Value Error's that may occur with the User Inputs which may give the wrong URL for the particular player data. Have only worked on it for a couple of days so not USER friendly.
